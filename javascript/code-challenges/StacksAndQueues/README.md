# Stacks and Queues

## Author: Stacy Burris

## Challenge

### Stack

+ Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.

+ Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.

### Queue

+ Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.

## Approach & Efficiency

+ Stack
  + push()
  + pop()
  + peek()
  + isEmpty()

+ Queues
  + front()
  + enqueue()
  + dequeue()
  + peek()
  + isEmpty()

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
