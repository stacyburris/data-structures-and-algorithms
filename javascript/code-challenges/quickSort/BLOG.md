# Quick Sort Explained

**The simplest algorithmic steps for Quicksort is:**

+ Pick a pivot element that divides the list into two sublists. We can select a random element as the pivot.
+ Reorder the list so that all elements less than the pivot element are placed before (towards its left) the pivot and all elements greater than the pivot are placed after it (towards its right).
+ Repeat steps 1 and 2 on both the smaller and larger list. That is, Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-array of elements with smaller values and separately to the sub-array of elements with greater values.

### Pseudo Code:

```
ALGORITHM QuickSort(arr, left, right)
    if left < right
        // Partition the array by setting the position of the pivot value 
        DEFINE position <-- Partition(arr, left, right)
        // Sort the left
        QuickSort(arr, left, position - 1)
        // Sort the right
        QuickSort(arr, position + 1, right)

ALGORITHM Partition(arr, left, right)
    // set a pivot value as a point of reference
    DEFINE pivot <-- arr[right]
    // create a variable to track the largest index of numbers lower than the defined pivot
    DEFINE low <-- left - 1
    for i <- left to right do
        if arr[i] <= pivot
            low++
            Swap(arr, i, low)

     // place the value of the pivot location in the middle.
     // all numbers smaller than the pivot are on the left, larger on the right. 
     Swap(arr, right, low + 1)
    // return the pivot index point
     return low + 1

ALGORITHM Swap(arr, i, low)
    DEFINE temp;
    temp <-- arr[i]
    arr[i] <-- arr[low]
    arr[low] <-- temp

### How does QuickSort Work

1. First find the "pivot" element in the array.
2. Start the left pointer at first element of the array.
3. Start the right pointer at last element of the array.
4. Compare the element pointing with left pointer and if it is less than the pivot element, then move the left pointer to the right (add 1 to the left index). Continue this until left side element is greater than or equal to the pivot element.
5. Compare the element pointing with right pointer and if it is greater than the pivot element, then move the right pointer to the left (subtract 1 to the right index). Continue this until right side element is less than or equal to the pivot element.
6. Check if left pointer is less than or equal to right pointer, then saw the elements in locations of these pointers.
7. Increment the left pointer and decrement the right pointer.
8. If index of left pointer is still less than the index of the right pointer, then repeat the process; else return the index of the left pointer.
